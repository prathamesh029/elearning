<p><h3><font color="#7F8C8D"><b>Python</b>is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very effective.

<p><h3><font color="#7F8C8D">Python's ease of use and compatibility across a variety of operating systems makes it an ideal language for a number of uses. Many complex websites either currently or historically have used Python to power their back ends, from YouTube to Instagram to Reddit, and thousands of other well-known examples. But Python isn't only a web language.

Python is the primary language used for the massive cloud computing project OpenStack, powering private and public clouds in data centers all over the world. It's also used to write desktop software, like Calibre, OpenShot, and the original client for BitTorrent. Many application written in other languages, such as Blender, allow for scripting by users in Python. It's also a popular language for machine learning, scientific, statistical, mathematical, and other types of specialized computing.

Even the Raspberry Pi gained its name from the founders plan to use the platform for teaching Python.

So in short, what is Python used for? May be Nearly everything!</font></h3></p>
<p><h3><font color="#7F8C8D"><b>Django</b> is a high-level Python Web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of Web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It's free and open source. Ridiculously fast.</font></h3></p>
